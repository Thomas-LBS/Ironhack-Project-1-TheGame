                    Legend says that long ago, there was an abundance of golden koi fish in the Yellow River in China. They made their way upstream, going against the current, building strength and perseverance.
                    <br><br>Golden hue made the river shimmer as if it was a river of gold. Halfway upstream, they came to a large waterfall, an impossible height that is too high to traverse. This waterfall is known as the “Dragon’s Gate” in Hunan province. Most of the koi turned back, going with the current to safer ground. 
                    <br><br>However, some koi stayed and attempted to jump and surpass the waterfall. Some of them got halfway, but then pummelled back downstream after they’ve lost momentum and energy.
                    <br><br>The spirits of the river watched the koi try over and over again, making fun of them as they found it amusing.<br><br>
