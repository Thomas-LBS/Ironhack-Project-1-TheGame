# Ironhack-Project-1-TheGame

<h2>Introduction</h2>

For your Module 1 project, you will create a browser-based game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The purpose of this project is to consolidate and practice all the knowledge you have acquired in this module. You may choose any game idea you like, but it must meet the technical requirements in this lesson.


<h3>Your game must meet the following technical requirements:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Render a game in the browser.</li>
<li>Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case:
<br>Your game must have logic that allows the player to win or lose.</li>
<li>Your game code must be organized in separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
<li>Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation.</li>
<li>Your game entities and elements must be organized using classes and OOP.</li>
<li>Have a repo on GitHub.</li>
<li>Have at least one (1) commit per day that you worked on.</li>
<li>You must deploy your game online using GitHub Pages so anyone can play it.</li>
<li>Your code should follow the principles of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<ul>
<li>A working game, built by you, that runs in the browser.</li>
<li>Your game deployed on GitHub Pages and available online.</li>
<li>The URL of the deployed game available online.</li>
<li>The URL of the GitHub repository for your game.</li>
<li>The URL of the slides for your project presentation.</li>
<li>You must present your game during Module 1 project presentations (last day of Module 1 project).</li>
</ul>
